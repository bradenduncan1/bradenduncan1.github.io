            <h3>Visual Hierarchy</h3>
        <h4>Spotify</h4>
        <div><a href="https://www.spotify.com/us/">Spotify.com</a></div>
        <div class="image1">
            <img src="../Images/Spotify.jpg" alt="Spotify">
        </div>
        <p>
            Spotify shows good use of visual hierarchy as they clearly prioritize where the user's attention is drawn.
            Especially on the mobile version I am drawn immediately to the good contrast between the background and front text. 
            They finish off the attention grab with a bright green button that tells you to "GET SPOTIFY FREE"

        <h3>Hick's Law</h3>
        <h4>Church of Jesus Christ</h4>
        <div><a href="https://churchofjesuschrist.org">ChurchofJesusChrist.org</a></div>
        <div class="image2">
            <img src="../Images/Church.jpg" alt="ChurchofJesusChrist">
        </div>
        <p>
           The website for the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints 
           is a good example for Hick's Law. The website gives major updates 
           in large, visually helpful icons. The most important headlines 
           and events will be noted first giving the user less immediate options 
           when approaching the site.
        </p>

    <section class="s3">
        <h3>White Space</h3>
        <h4>Quip</h4>
        <div><a href="https://www.getquip.com/">getquip.com</a></div>
        <div class="image1">
            <img src="../Images/Quip.jpg" alt="Quip">
        </div>
        <p>
            Quip is another example of good UX. Quip takes a large image that 
            simply tells the user what they're offering. It combines space along
            with meaningful gaps in content. The picture is large on desktop or mobile
            to give the user a sense of simplicity. White space is effective in giving
            the user enough of "nothing" to appreciate the beauty of the content more.
